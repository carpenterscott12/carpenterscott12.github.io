Make Me a Sandwich is a word game in which you try to find all words possible to create with the letters of an initial word. The initial word can either be a word you input yourself, or it can be a random word selected by the game. 

The word list used in the game is a modified version of the YAWL list. See "YAWL License.txt" for the license information. The primary modification to the list is removing all words which are less than 3 letters long and more than 7 letters long. You can learn more about the YAWL word list and get a copy of it here: https://github.com/elasticdog/yawl
